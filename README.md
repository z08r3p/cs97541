CLD 317 Fall 2024   Assignment Descriptions
Weekly Synthesis   Assignments (5   x 5%) = 25%
Over   the semester,   you   will complete 5   weekly synthesis assignments of   your choice   from weeks 2   – 11. For each synthesis,   you   will bring   together content and ideas   from our class         lecture and discussions, experiences and understandings gained   from class activities, and   concepts and approaches   from each of   the   week’s readings. Your synthesis   will be cohesive and   thoughtful and show   the depth of   your understanding. Each   weekly synthesis   should be 1 page long, double spaced (if shorter,   you   will need to dig in deeper).   Please   include citations and references (7th   ed.   APA).   Your   weekly synthesis assignments   are due   BEFORE the next class (due dates are on D2L) and are   to be submitted to D2L. Because of   the nature of these assignments (i.e.,   you choose   the   weeks   you   would like   to complete),      late assignments   will not be accepted. The assignment rubric is available   for review on   D2L.
Math Concept Mapping   (15%) + Learning/Lesson Plan (10%) = 25%Your math concept mapping and learning/lesson plan assignments stem   from   the   first 5      weeks of the course.   Both assignments are due BEFORE class in Week 7 (Oct. 22 for 011   and Oct. 28   for 021).   Please submit   to respective assignment   folders on D2L. Rubrics are   available   for review on D2L.
The math concept mapping   will allow   you   to show   your understanding of developing math   concepts, content, and skills as   you identify and map out   the math   that comes before   a   chosen learning outcome or expectation and   the math that   follows. In   your math concept   mapping,   you   will choose a math (or math-related) learning outcome or   expectation   from   one of preschool, kindergarten, grade one, grade   two, or   grade   three (i.e., from How   Does   Learning   Happen?, The Kindergarten Program, or   the Ontario 1-8 Math Curriculum) and   map out   the math concepts, content, and skills   that   come before   that outcome (i.e.,   what      is   the prerequisite math knowledge and understandings?) and   those   that   follow (i.e.,   what      is   that outcome or expectation prerequisite   for?). For example,   you might choose a grade 1   math learning outcome and   you   would   then look back   to   preschool and kindergarten   concepts, content, and skills   that are required   to engage   with   that grade 1 outcome and   then look   forward   to   the grade 2 and   grade 3 concepts, content, and skills   that extend   from   and build on   the grade 1 outcome.
The learning/lesson plan   will engage   with   the learning outcome or expectation   you chose in   the math concept mapping. Applying   the assessment and planning explored in class,   you will create a detailed learning or lesson plan that engages children in early   years math.
Your learning or lesson plan can follow any   format   you   wish (several examples   will be shared   with   you in class   that   you can adapt) but should include   the   following components:
•          Learning outcome or expectation (see above)   from How   Does Learning   Happen?   The Kindergarten Program, or Ontario Math 1-8 Curriculum (grades 1-3 only)
•         Assessment of learning outcome including strategies and related   tools
•          Minds on introduction
•         Active and engaging body
•          Reflective consolidation
•          Organi代 写CLD 317 Fall 2024 Assignment DescriptionsMatlab

•          Resources and references
Please include enough detail for a supply ECE or   teacher   to   follow and include any   assessment tools (rubrics, checklists, etc.) and activity sheets   that   you may be using. Your   plan should be   your own; do not use learning or lesson plans   that   you   find online (most are   not great anyways).
Course Mapping (20%) + Sequence of Plans (20%) =   40%
The course mapping and sequence of   plans assignments extend from   the math concept mapping and learning/lesson plan assignments and draw   from   weeks 6-12 of   the course. Both are   the course mapping and sequence of plans are due by   the end of   the day on Dec.   4 (11:59 pm). Please submit   to   their respective   folders on D2L.   Rubrics are available   for review on D2L.
In   the course mapping assignment,   you   will bring   together   the big ideas   from   the last 7 weeks of the course (math and mindset and social emotional   learning; experience and play; Indigenous knowing and being; diversity; inclusion;   families and communities; and   environment(s)).   Your comprehensive course map   will   take   whatever   form   you   wish (e.g., website, Prezi, book, etc.) and   will draw   from content and ideas   from course lectures and discussions, experiences and understandings   gained   from class activities, and concepts and approaches   from each of   the   weekly readings. Please   feel   free   to get creative   with   your   mapwork!
In   your sequence of plans,   you   will revisit   your learning/lesson plan and situate it as   the 2nd   of a sequence of 3 learning/lesson plans (i.e., 3 plans   that   follow one another).   You   will take up   feedback   from   the earlier planning assignment and consider   the content and approaches   from   weeks 6-12 in   your revised plan.   You   will also create 2 additional plans:   one   to come before   your revised plan and one   to   follow (you   will have 3 plans in all). You are   free   to choose a   format that   you   wish but each plan will include   the   following   components:
•          Learning outcome or expectation (see above)   from How   Does Learning   Happen?   The Kindergarten Program, or Ontario Math 1-8 Curriculum (grades 1-3 only)
•         Assessment of learning outcome including strategies and related   tools
•         Adaptations and modifications
•         Curricular considerations and connections
•          Minds on introduction
•         Active and engaging body
•          Reflective consolidation
•          Organizational planning (timing, materials, groupings, etc.)
•          Resources and referencesAs   with the previous planning assignment, include enough detail in   your sequence   so   that   a supply ECE or   teacher could easily   follow   the 3 plans. Also, include any supplementary material   for   the plan (e.g., rubrics, activity sheets, etc.).
Engagement (5% Self-Assessment + 5% from instructor)   = 10%
Your active participation in   the course and meaningful engagement in activities and discussions is required.   You are expected to attend and be on   time   for all classes; be prepared for and present in class (i.e., readings completed, not on phone, not   working on other courses, etc.); and participate respectfully and collaboratively in all class   discussions and activities.   The   rubric is available on D2L   for review.
